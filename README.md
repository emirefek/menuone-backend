## About project

The "MenuOne" glorious project idea of mine. Since I started learning code I started to project with the idea of basic SaaS QR codes for restaurants. This project idea was my test bench. While working on version1 I got in to a job then halted that project, worked 5 months in there after quiting. I started version2, then got a freelancer job. Halted version2 and completed that job in 2 months. This was supposed to be version3's backend. I started learning NestJS. But I think there are many competitiors in that area so I decided to cancel this project and opensourcing my backend code. It's not completed I guess there will be bunch of bugs.

This is emirefek and that's the story of this repo. I hope this helps to someone who wanna learn NestJS. There isn't any license of the code. So you can use it as you wish.
